# Nutrify.Me
REST API for the input of calories.
- API Users must be able to create an account and log in.
- All API calls must be authenticated.
- Implement at least three roles with different permission levels: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on their owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD only users, and an admin would be able to CRUD all records and users.
- Each entry has a date, time, text, and number of calories.
- If the number of calories is not provided, the API should connect to a Calories API provider (for example https://www.nutritionix.com) and try to get the number of calories for the entered meal.
- User setting â€“ Expected number of calories per day.
- Each entry should have an extra boolean field set to true if the total for that day is less than expected number of calories per day, otherwise should be false
- The API must be able to return data in the JSON format
